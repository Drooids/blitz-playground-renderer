Pipeline:
	Vertices:
		Just vertices

	VOB:
		The VBO(Vertex Buffer Object) is one of the “objects” of OpenGL. 
		It holds all of a single vertex attributes for an object. Not all vertexes, 
		but all vertexes of one type, like all positions or all colors. So you’ll 
		end up with one VBO for positions, one VBO for colors, etc…
		
	VAO:
		

	glVertexAttribPointer:
		After getting the attribute from the shader, tell the system what type of element it is?
